I liked the first part - but I think you posted it into the wrong track
The second-to-last paragraph feels like you're trying to say, "Be an atheist" without using the word 'religion' - though maybe now I'm being presumptive because of our previous conversations!
Which is a personal opinion, not really a discussion of a philosophical idea
Though I guess it is Epistemology...
The spirit of the post reminded me of Protagoras, the Sophist
"You can't know for sure whether your stories are correct or not, so you shouldn't enforce them on others."
The part un-said is, "That's the job of the state!"

ah yes - it's not the right track
you might be correct about the second to last paragraph, but I think it's broader - but you might not be incorrect
and you are saying I'm a sophist! now that's bad
the job of the state?
I think the second to last is still philosophy, in that I am proposing a way of being in the world
I am partly proposing an answer to the perennial question of "how we should conduct our lives"
of course, any solution uttered by one person is going to be their opinion
unless there is an absolute, universal solution
which at present is not really forthcoming
the second to last is highly philosophical, though yes, it presents one position - one could argue that it is ok to lead your life on made up stories. One could argue that some stories have more merits than others (science has proven to work much better for medicine than religion). One could argue that we are story creatures, and that stories are a political currency. One could argue that some stories hurt us, while some help us. All things I do intend to explore in further posts.

[19:53, 5/18/2020] Philozopher: le seul domaine ou on essaie d'enlever l'opinon, c'est la science
[19:53, 5/18/2020] Philozopher: c'est d'ailleurs la caracteristique fondamentale de l'histoire qu'elabore la science

I'm getting more pushback that my second to last paragraph is opinion
I think it ruffles quite a few feathers
and also, that philosophy has a fair bit of opinion in it in general
the only place where we really weed out opinion is in science
where we replace opinion by verification against Nature
otherwise, there is little objectivity out there
if you notice, Plato purports to have a method when examining various questions, which would be better than mere opinion, but I'm not sure the conclusions of the dialogues are always "objective" - when they even have a conclusion
if we always require objectivity from philosophy, it's going to be quite limited - and in fact, we are going to do science, and not philosophy, I'm afraid

I want to talk about stories we make
we are creatures that live by stories is my point
but it's not good or bad
it's what it is
and it's necessary

11:20
Someone
Fair enough

11:20
Philozopher
and it's good in many cases

11:20
Someone
But you do say that stories do not have the same importance as science and reason

11:20
Philozopher
11:20
I think I haven't gotten there yet
what's going on is that religion is one of the big "stories" we have in our lives, so it always comes back
science/reason is another "story" to me
it has very different characteristics from the religious "story"

11:22
Someone
So you think that, just like other stories, I have the right to not believe in science and reason and that's an equally valid and justifiable position as someone who is a scientist?

11:22
Philozopher
no - I did not say that
the story from science has special characteristics
it tries to check itself against reality
which gives it a different status

11:23
Someone
Then inwhat way isit a story?

11:24
Philozopher
well "story" is my catch-all term for whatever we use in our heads to make sense of the world

11:24
Someone
You mean more of an explanation?

11:24
Philozopher
yeah
the religious person uses a "story" to make sense of the world
the scientist uses another "story" to make sense of the world
the insane uses his/her own story about the world - that one happens to be completely disconnected
I think we can't avoid trying to make sense of the world - it's what we do
one way or another
does that make sense? It's the kind of stuff I want to talk about in upcoming posts
or is it trivial, or boring, or stupid?

11:27
Someone
I think it's a fair observation that humans are naturally inquisitive, unlike other creatures.
Still doesn't explain why science is a better or more superior story.
Doesn't even explain why it's a different story.

11:28
Philozopher
better and superior don't mean nada
it's different because it tries to check itself against reality
so it "works"

11:28
Someone
What do you mean, it works?
Also mythology also tries to check itself.

11:29
Philozopher
it's kinda useful for harnessing electricity, vaccinesâ€¦ that kind of stuff
how does mythology check itself?

11:29
Someone
I was reading my son a story about how the mountains used to have wings and then indra clipped them and made them stationary.
That lines up with reality, mountains don't move anymore.

11:30
Philozopher
that part yes, but the part about wings?
geology would dig the ground and look for wings, to check itself

11:34
Someone
But the wings have been cut my friend.
The important point you are missing is that science is not a story of the past, like every other mythology.
It's a story of the future.
The thing that science can do tagt mythology cannot is male predictions about the future.
About things we have not obesevrs so far.
