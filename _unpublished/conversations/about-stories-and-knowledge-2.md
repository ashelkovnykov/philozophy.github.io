### Conversation
- Typo in the second-to-last sentence of the first paragraph: "But among in the ocean..."
- Weird transition between the last two sentences, that isn't grammatically correct. I think both need to have their structure changed to get the idea across (I can provide an example if you want)
- So, right off the bat: science isn't a story, it's a collection of facts and theories for making predictions about future facts. It can explain things that used to be explained by religion or philosophy, but it isn't a substitute for either of those things. For example: science can answer what the temperature of the sun is on a given day and why, but it can't answer what (if anything) we owe our parents for having created us.
- This might be a nit-pick, but the idea of "it doesn't just live in the head of one person" is a bad example. The Star Wars canon is an objective set of facts about a fake world that is objective, and outside the imagination of a single individual, but that doesn't make it real, or even a philosophical story of the kind you're discussing in this post.
- I don't really understand the point of this post, as science, religion, and philosophy are not by definition in conflict with each other

Hello to K too!
so the basic idea is not agreeing with you
I'm proposing that indeed we are story creatures, and that science is another "story" we use about nature, but that this "story" is special - it aims to be universal, and it's not just an arbitrary opinion, it lives in an inter-subjective space
"story" = "model" (as in ML) is my unifying idea to explain how we function
but not all "stories" are equivalent - some are opinion, some are science
fact ... I mean, what is a "fact"?
there are deep reasons to say that science is a "story" (albeit one with very special characteristics): for example, it is not clear what a "fact" is (I propose a definition: something we all agree on), and after all, we don't really know what's "out there". We have senses, mental pictures, but who knows what's on the "other side" of our senses and actually excites them?

The post is probably written without explaining my position clearly so it is surprising. I'll probably rewrite to explain what I mean by "story" first.
A Today at 1:16 PM
But there are some things which will never be a part of the "story" then
Science can't explain the majority of philosophy
so there's an entire school of thought that doesn't fit into this "story"
The Philozopher Today at 1:41 PM
hmmm - so my "system" of philosophy which I'm proposing, is based on: humans have "stories" in their heads for everything - where "story" is a technical term, not implying arbitrariness or banality, or randomness
it's more like a generalization of "model"
religion is a set of "stories", science is a set of "stories", philosophy ...
"story" means "explanation", "model", "rationalization"
when we think about anything, we think in terms of words, and those words make "stories"
in our heads
maybe I need to explain that first
A Today at 1:49 PM
But what I'm saying is that these stories don't overlap 100%
There are things which science doesn't purport to explain, things which philosophy doesn't puport to explain, and things which religion doesn't purport to explain
So it's possible to believe in "settled" science, have an opinion on "unsettled" science (e.g. string theory vs. multi-verse), believe in a particular philosophy (e.g. Communism, Objectivism, etc.), and have a religion all at the same time
some of these "stories" are not mutually exclusive is my point, using your definition
But they are presented as being so
The Philozopher Today at 1:52 PM
correct - we have a set of stories in our heads for various things - they may or may not overlap, absolutely true
I present them as being mutually exclusive?
the point I wanted to make was that they don't all have the same "value", because some aim to have a verification attached to them, while some don't care to have any verification attached to them
anybody can do whatever they want with any story they want - I hint at that in one paragraph when I say it's not necessarily bad that there is no verification
A Today at 1:55 PM
I was interpreting the stories as mutually exclusive
So, if that's wrong, sorry about that
The Philozopher Today at 1:56 PM
hmmm - all good points  though
no no - no worries
A Today at 1:56 PM
I wonder why I got that understanding?
The Philozopher Today at 1:56 PM
I need to rewrite that post to start explaining my "system" of "stories" and what I mean by "story"
A Today at 1:56 PM
However - I still don't think that there's anything particularly valuable in the article then
Because since science can't cover certain topics, it doesn't matter if it's verifiable or not
You can't verify whether it's wrong to kill a man in the woods
The Philozopher Today at 1:57 PM
true - so the "stories" around morality may not be amenable to "verification" like science is
so it is worthwhile to distinguish stories we hold in our heads in terms of verifiable/not verifiable
I'm doing a typology of stories
A Today at 1:58 PM
Hmmmm
In that case
if this is article 2, or 3, out of a series
that has a whole treatise on stories
then it could be worthwile
The Philozopher Today at 1:58 PM
yes
A Today at 1:58 PM
I was interpretting this as "one and done"
The Philozopher Today at 1:58 PM
I have that "system" in my head
and I used it to write this article, but maybe that article jumps a few steps and so seems to come out of the blue
A Today at 1:59 PM
Okay, I had many misconceptions about the purpose of this article then
The Philozopher Today at 1:59 PM
I have another one coming up about another type of verification
this verification was against facts of nature
there is another type of verification
then that's it
which leads to exactly 2 types of knowledge
where knowledge is always "verified", using one of the 2 verification mechanisms
what the other verification mechanism is, well, you will have to wait for the next article
I was trying to build to my "system" by showing first stories that have one type of verification, then another article showing the other type of verification, then synthesizing into "hey there is no other type of knowledge"
but I need another article first to explain "story"
also, I realized that these 2 types of knowledge correspond to analytic and synthetic judgments in Kant
I need to dig into that more
the reason I'm using "story" I guess is that although science is "factual", most people take it to be just another "story" or account of how the world works. So instead of getting into an opposition between what is factually true and what is opinion, I prefer to say that science is a story, yes, but with a special trait of verification that other stories don't have.
Myths are never verified.
Evolution could be called yet another myth, but, it has some claims to verification.
it is distinguished in that regard
but to most people it's just another "story" anyway
