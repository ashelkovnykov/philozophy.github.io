I want to talk about stories we make
we are creatures that live by stories is my point
but it's not good or bad
it's what it is
and it's necessary

11:20
Someone
Fair enough

11:20
Philozopher
and it's good in many cases

11:20
Someone
But you do say that stories do not have the same importance as science and reason

11:20
Philozopher
11:20
I think I haven't gotten there yet
what's going on is that religion is one of the big "stories" we have in our lives, so it always comes back
science/reason is another "story" to me
it has very different characteristics from the religious "story"

11:22
Someone
So you think that, just like other stories, I have the right to not believe in science and reason and that's an equally valid and justifiable position as someone who is a scientist?

11:22
Philozopher
no - I did not say that
the story from science has special characteristics
it tries to check itself against reality
which gives it a different status

11:23
Someone
Then inwhat way isit a story?

11:24
Philozopher
well "story" is my catch-all term for whatever we use in our heads to make sense of the world

11:24
Someone
You mean more of an explanation?

11:24
Philozopher
yeah
the religious person uses a "story" to make sense of the world
the scientist uses another "story" to make sense of the world
the insane uses his/her own story about the world - that one happens to be completely disconnected
I think we can't avoid trying to make sense of the world - it's what we do
one way or another
does that make sense? It's the kind of stuff I want to talk about in upcoming posts
or is it trivial, or boring, or stupid?

11:27
Someone
I think it's a fair observation that humans are naturally inquisitive, unlike other creatures.
Still doesn't explain why science is a better or more superior story.
Doesn't even explain why it's a different story.

11:28
Philozopher
better and superior don't mean nada
it's different because it tries to check itself against reality
so it "works"

11:28
Someone
What do you mean, it works?
Also mythology also tries to check itself.

11:29
Philozopher
it's kinda useful for harnessing electricity, vaccines… that kind of stuff
how does mythology check itself?

11:29
Someone
I was reading my son a story about how the mountains used to have wings and then indra clipped them and made them stationary.
That lines up with reality, mountains don't move anymore.

11:30
Philozopher
that part yes, but the part about wings?
geology would dig the ground and look for wings, to check itself

11:34
Someone
But the wings have been cut my friend.
The important point you are missing is that science is not a story of the past, like every other mythology.
It's a story of the future.
The thing that science can do tagt mythology cannot is male predictions about the future.
About things we have not obesevrs so far.

[13:53, 5/25/2020] Philozopher je veux en arriver au fait que nos "histoires" sont des "modeles" pour comprendre le monde
[13:54, 5/25/2020] Philozopher je vais faire ca a travers plusieurs posts
[13:54, 5/25/2020] Philozopher ca vous parait bien? interessasnt?
[13:54, 5/25/2020] Philozopher ou completement nul?
[13:54, 5/25/2020] Philozopher va y avoir du ML en comparaison
[13:55, 5/25/2020] Philozopher plus tard
[14:20, 5/25/2020] Philozopher ma these centrale c'est qu'on fait des modeles pour comprendre le monde, comme en ML, même si ces modeles sont des "histoires" plutôt que des modeles mathematiques
[14:21, 5/25/2020] Philozopher apres on peut parler des caracteristiques des diverses histoires, de quelles histoires sont acceptables pour vivre ensemble, si certaines histoires ont des avantages sur d'autres
[14:21, 5/25/2020] Philozopher on peut appliquer a la politique, a la psychologie ...
[14:22, 5/25/2020] Philozopher on peut se demander s'il y a de vraies differences entres les modeles qu'on a dans nos tetes et le ML - donc si on est très differents des machines
[14:22, 5/25/2020] Philozopher et ainsi de suite
