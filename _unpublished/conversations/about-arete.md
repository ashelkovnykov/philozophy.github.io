Just learning about the Neo-Platonists
Very interesting interpretation, to combine the Doctrine of Forms with Christianity
Very clever, methinks
I also think it's very interesting how Plato's ideas are like a "Greatest Hits" of the people who came before him
He does an incredible job of combining all of the ideas he considers good from before him
Alex Yesterday at 6:56 PM
How well do you know Plato's theories? I ask because I delivered that big book of Plato's works to you, and because I have a question about one part of his theory that maybe you understand better
Philozopher Today at 6:44 AM
yeah - the Ideas were useful to Christians, because they don't live in this material world, so it goes well with the concept of a (bad) material world and the (good) supernatural world (which is the domain of God) - by contrast, Christians were not big fans of Democritus, Epicurus... who postulated the existence of only this material world of atoms
Ask away - I won't claim to know Plato so well, but I know some.
this dichotomy between this material world and the other world is related to the words "immanent" and "transcendent"
Philozopher Today at 6:56 AM
the thing is, in religions, there are a lot of supernatural things that we don't see - where do those live? you need some metaphysical commitment that there is "another world"
that transcends this immanent world
another tidbit about ideas: the 20th century French philosopher Deleuze rejected Truth, Beauty... (Plato's Ideas) as worthwhile concepts because he rejected transcendence - so that debate about immanent/transcendent is still ongoing ...
Alex Today at 7:33 AM
The book summarizes Plato's ideas about immortality regarding The Line
According to the book's version of Plato, the weakest form of immortality is to bare children
A higher form of immortality is to teach people, and thus impact their souls
An even higher form of immortality is to contribute to the sciences
The highest form of immorality is, "to contact Beauty and produce true virtue"
What the hell does that last part mean? I can at least feel like I understand everything else Plato discussed, but I have no idea what "contacting Beauty and producing true virtue" is
Philozopher Today at 11:38 AM
maybe "contacting Beauty" means contemplating what is beautiful and thus gives pleasure
while "produce true virtue" may refer to that greek concept of "arete", which is like "excellence"
so "produce true virtue" would be like using all your abilities to fulfill your destiny, while being a "good person", i.e. just, smart, clever, strong, courageous, maybe an astute leader of men
somebody outstanding that will be remembered as a model of what an exemplary life should be like
Alex Today at 11:41 AM
I see
Like an Achilles
or an Odysseus
Philozopher Today at 11:42 AM
or Ulysses
Odysseus yes
they liked that Odysseus in particular
to have "phronesis"
which is like the skill of thinking on your feet in difficult situations and being clever
arete/virtue/phronesis are all linked and related
but mostly very dated now
there is something called "virtue ethics"
which says, more or less, that it is good to be fair, patient, balanced, brave ...
I don't know - to me it conjures up images of knights in the Middle Ages being "good" persons while others were not so "virtuous"
probably with Christianity, you could add to the list of virtues that you should have faith, love your neighbor, practice charity, pray ...
but the Ancient Greeks didn't have that yet
in their "virtues"
Alex Today at 11:47 AM
They had doing sacrifices on the right days
Philozopher Today at 11:47 AM
there you go
I think there is a place in Meno where they say that being virtuous includes seeking vengeance and punishing your enemies
that would probably not work in Christianity
like, you wouldn't be virtuous if you didn't fight to right the wrongs you've been done
(for the Greeks)
Alex Today at 11:49 AM
Sulla had a quote like that
I think on his tombstone?
No friend helped me and no enemy wronged me that I did not repay in full
something like that
Philozopher Today at 11:50 AM
that sounds balanced and virtuous :slight_smile:
but to a modern mind, "virtue" and "virtue ethics" sound strange
chivalry comes to mind, which is so old, but also self-righteous
nobility
we probably like to have more justifications, and are more used to questioning today
why is it "virtuous" to be patient or temperate?
Alex Today at 11:54 AM
I think it's because these things are considered more on a scale now, and people are used to getting contradictory advice
Or maybe it's because every skill has it's appropriate location
or environment I should say
You want to be patient, don't jump too soon or you can miss out on an opportunity, or never give your enemies a chance to make a mistake
but don't be too slow!
You want to be quick thinking, and decisive!
Well, which is it? Is it one in one situation, and the other in another?
Or is it a balance of the two?
Philozopher Today at 11:56 AM
also, maybe in the time of the Greeks, being patient and courageous was important because they controlled less of what happened to them: they didn't have medicine like we have today for example, so you'd better be patient and courageous for that toothache or that cold
like, being able to control your emotions was paramount, whereas today we can numb ourselves with drugs
or escape with drugs
whereas they had a hard life with not so many escapes
Alex Today at 11:57 AM
I would contest that it's not an escape
As in, people use drugs as an escape but in most situations it's not, it's just a delaying mechanism
possibly until the very end
Philozopher Today at 12:00 PM
sure - I think my point was that "virtue" sounds very centered on what you can improve in yourself (because you don't control what happens to you so much), whereas we are more used (maybe too much) to the idea that we can control our external circumstances (or think we can), since we've had science, which gave electricity, ... the Greeks had better develop a lot of "internal" qualities, wheres we have that idea in the back of our minds that we are in control/can change the world ...
Alex Today at 12:01 PM
that's interesting
"Why do I need to change - I'll just change my environment"
Philozopher Today at 12:01 PM
it's mostly unconscious
but the Greeks didn't have that luxury
so they needed more internal fortitude
fortitude is pretty good for that "virtue"
Alex Today at 12:02 PM
Right
If you're not strong, you better get strong or you're not going to last
Philozopher Today at 12:02 PM
yeah
there is also a social dimension to "arete": you have to be fair, a good leader of men
because they lived in tight-knit cities where politics was important
for us, who cares, we are small specs with no power in politics and we don't trust politicians anyway
we are way more cynical
cynicism would probably be opposite to "virtue"
