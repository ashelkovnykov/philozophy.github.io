<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Traite-dAtheologie-Metaphysique-Michel-Onfray/dp/2246648017">Traité d'Athéologie: Physique de la Métaphysique, Michel Onfray, 2005</a>
</h3>
The topic of atheism has been explored for a long time now, and, for example, Nietzsche, Sartre and many others have given us authoritative writings in that area already. Onfray's book is part ranting and complaining about monotheisms, part history to support his complaints, but one does not get the feeling that anything new is being shared here.
