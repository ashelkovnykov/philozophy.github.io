<H1 align="center" id="hylozoism">Hylozoism</H1>
Hylozoism is the philosophical point of view that matter is in some sense alive. The concept dates back at least as far as the Milesian school of pre-Socratic philosophers. The term was coined by the English philosopher Ralph Cudworth in 1678.

<H1 align="center" id="monism">Monism</H1>
The metaphysical and theological view that there is only one principle, essence, substance, or energy. Monism is distinguished from dualism, which holds that ultimately there are exactly two such principles, and from pluralism, which holds that there are many such principles.

<hr class="rounded">
<H1 align="center" id="pantheism">Pantheism</H1>
The view that everything is of an all-encompassing immanent God; or that the universe, or nature, and God are equivalent. More detailed definitions tend to emphasize the idea that natural law, existence and/or the universe (the sum total of all that was, is, or shall be) is represented or personified in the theological principle of 'God'. The existence of a transcendent supreme extraneous to nature is denied. Depending on how this is understood, such a view may be presented as tantamount to atheism, deism or theism.
