So the planet is warming. It makes for beautiful or fiery speeches that maybe sound inspirational to some, but sound empty to me. I know mankind. We will not manage to find a consensus or take rational steps to reduce emissions. No, instead, the planet will continue warming, and some places will become even more unlivable, and there will be refugees, migrations, wars, famines, unpredictable and brutal weather. And mankind will try to make do with that, to adapt as best as it can. But I don't believe we will be able to fix anything.
