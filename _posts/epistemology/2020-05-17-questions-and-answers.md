Man asks a lot of questions. How did the Universe came into being? Why is there Being at all? How should we live our lives and conduct ourselves? Is there an absolute morality, rules of conduct that would be good for all and all times? Is there anything beyond what we can see? We want to know if there exists something beyond what we can see? What happens after we die?

But should tbose questions have answers? It's one thing to ask, but why should all questions have answers? We desperately want to know, but there is no reason our craving should be fulfilled.

We can look for answers, and maybe that's what it means to be human: asking questions and looking for answers. This may be fruitful sometimes. For many questions about the workings of Nature, we have been able to find answers. For example, we have obtained a better understanding of how our body works and devised treatments and drugs that alleviate some of our miseries. We have been able to understand how electricity works and derived many benefits from that. Usually, useful answers have been found via rational thinking, observation, experiments, confrontation of our ideas with reality - and in limited contexts: asking how electricity works is a far cry from more ultimate questions, such as how the Universe came into being. 

Those larger questions have usually not yielded to rational thinking, and they may never be solved. Maybe they don't have answers. Maybe our asking is clumsy and there is no answer to be had.

Some make up answers though, concoct opiums of the mind to intoxicate themselves, because they can't live without answers to all their questions. Their childish psychological make-up is that they are always entitled to getting answers. But we should grow up and not delude ourselves, not lie to ourselves in our quest for answers. We should have the courage to acknowledge our limitations, our boundedness and inability to find answers to the big questions. We should be honest and recognize when we don't know, and not become enmeshed with made-up answers to the point of mistaking those ideas with reality. Trying to create a reality that conforms to what we wish is not healthy. We can choose to believe a story we like, for practical purposes, because it helps us in your lives, or just because we can, or just because we temporarily want to believe some story, till we find a better one. But we should recognize that those stories are arbitrary rather than true, that they stem from our immature desire for answers, rather than accurately reflect reality. We want to be demiurges, create reality, but we can't, and our stories can't be stronger than reality. And above all, we should not force others to accept our made-up stories. There is really no justification for that. Nobody has any right to assert their own stories as truer than anybody else's stories. 

So, we should be honest, acknowledge our shortcomings in understanding the world, recognize that we are not entitled to get answers to all our questions, and we should be courageous and not try to assuage our anxieties by conjuring up fake realities.
