When mass shootings occur in the US, an often heard argument is that the weapons are not the issue, because, the guns don't shoot from their own volition. Someone has to pull the trigger. That someone is the guilty party, not the gun (therefore, there is no need to limit the number of guns, is the implied conclusion, of course). There is a problem though. Guns are tools meant for one purpose, and one purpose only: kill people. By contrast, consider the knife. It can be used as a weapon, but it has many other uses too. The axe? You can use it to kill people, but also to cut down trees. But the gun is different: it has no other purpose whatsoever but to kill people. It has been optimized for that sole purpose. The teleological raison d'Ãªtre of the gun (including all manners of handguns and rifles), is precisely to kill as efficiently as possible, and you cannot use a gun for any other purpose. Guns exist only to harm and kill. It is disingenuous to argue that guns are not guilty.
