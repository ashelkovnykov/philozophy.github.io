Life is shutting down. We have been working from home for a week already, and now the schools are closed too, and panic buying is emptying the shelves, no more pasta or toilet paper. We are keeping our social distances pretty well, staying at home. As long as you are not sick and don't have a job that depends on foot traffic to your store, it is a bit like vacations without really being on vacation, we still have to work and to deal with the kids at home. 

I'm reading about Spinoza. The idea of "conatus" should be discarded by now, we have better concepts coming from science, and we are so deep into the current scientific era that concepts such as "conatus" are now hard for us to accept. The idea that "god" is in fact something like the ultimate ground of being (from Buddhism) speaks to me, much more than the concept of a personal, anthropomorphic god as can be found in christianity. I'm going to continue investigating Spinoza.
