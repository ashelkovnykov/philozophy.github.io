Everybody is so busy these days. We are busy with work, we have hobbies, we are deluged with news, information and entertainment on the internet. We can't sit still. We can't rest, be quiet in a place. Because that would be too scary. We would be alone with ourselves, and with our condition, and we can't take that. The true story is that no matter who we are, poor or wealthy, powerful or exploited, we are all destined to die and disappear in oblivion. But that is a very hard story to stomach. So we prefer to intoxicate ourselves constantly with occupations, stories we make up, that we desperately want to believe to forget our finitude, misery and ultimate demise. Most of that story making is actually unconscious, or we are enmeshed into it by others, by society. But stop and look, and you will see that we live in a fiction we create, a very intricate story that we make up to entertain ourselves.
