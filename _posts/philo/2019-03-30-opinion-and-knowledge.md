Sometimes, it seems people see philosophy as a battleground where they can assert their opinions while trying to demolish those of others. Is that really what philosophy is about? In his dialogue Gorgias, Plato saw the common belief or popular opinion (δόξα, doxa) as opposed to knowledge (ἐπιστήμη, episteme). Doxa was used by the Sophists to persuade and manipulate people. But for Plato, true knowledge was derived through the application of reason, not by appeal to feelings, subjective ideas or what people believe. We could say a lot more here, but for now, I just want to keep the idea that critical thinking, skepticism and reason are better paths to knowledge than opinion. Maybe less colors and fireworks here, but more reason.
