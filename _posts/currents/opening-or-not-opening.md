In this time of pandemic, where the COVID-19 disease has shut down many countries, we are faced with a thorny question: when will be appropriate to get out of confinement? There are at least three angles to this question but let's focus on one particular aspect of the ethics of public health, namely, whether imposing restrictions on a population in the name of public health clashes with individual freedoms. 

Let's take the example of confinement, where the population of a country is asked to stay at home by its otherwise democratic government (think about democracy such as France, Germany or the US), maybe with the police patrolling the streets to enforce the confinement. Citizens do not, temporarily, enjoy freedom of movement, in order to stop or slow down the transmission of the SARS-COV-2 virus, which is new, and quite deadly for certain subgroups of the population (the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions in particular). Is it morally justifiable to curtail individual liberties in order to reduce the impact of an epidemic?

There are many possible answers and different countries have taken different stances on that issue. Citizens in the same country have also been divided. For example, in the United States, some took the position that the State should not interfere with their personal freedom, and that they should be able to decide for themselves what to do about this new virus, or whether to wear masks in public. On the other hand, a church was burnt down in Mississippi after the pastor had filed a lawsuit challenging gathering restrictions. The arsonist left a note: "Bet you stay home now".

Because these questions involve subjective evaluations of personal risk, and because public health deals with prevention for anonymous, aggregate benefits, they are undecidable on rational grounds.
