Thales of Miletus is recorded as the first Greek philosopher. He was regarded in his day as a scientist. His scientific exploits focussed primarily on astronomy: construction of an almanac, the predictions of eclipses, and navigation by stars.

Thales asserted that all matter was ultimately composed of a single element, and that that element is water. Through the process of evaporation, water becomes air. Through the process of freezing, water becomes ice, and then eventually earth.

Thales' contribution to philsophy is the question he asked, not the answer he put forth. He is the first recorded Greek to posit the ultimate nature of the world from a scientific/philosophical point of view, as opposed to a religious one. As such, he represents the beginning of a transition from myth to science.
